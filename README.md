Write a horizontal report on the topic you have chosen. The talks in this subject will show the projects vertically, i.e., they will contain information regarding the history, the goals, the members, the licenses, the related industry, the technologies, the governance, etc. of the project. Each student has to select one of these aspects and write a report on how the selected aspect is handled in all the projects that have been presented in the subject.

For instance: a student may choose to write a report on the governance of the projects. This report should include information from as many of the projects that have been presented in this subject as possible.

Review the horizontal reports of three other students. Students will have to retrieve a copy of other reports and include enhancements, comments, suggestions, etc.

The deadlines are however the ones given in this academic year's calendar: So, we will have a first deadline with the horizontal report a couple of weeks before the final deadline (Wednesday March 19th) and a final deadline on April 3rd.
