We are requested to write horizontal report one topic we choose in each projects that have been presented in this subject. The talks in this subject will show the projects vertically, i.e., they will contain information regarding the history, the goals, the members, the licenses, the related industry, the technologies, the governance, etc. of the project. Each student has to select one of these aspects and write a report on how the selected aspect is handled in all the projects that have been presented in the subject.

For instance: a student may choose to write a report on the governance of the projects. This report should include information from as many of the projects that have been presented in this subject as possible.

Then we will have to review the horizontal reports of three other students. Students will have to retrieve a copy of other reports and include enhancements, comments, suggestions, etc.
